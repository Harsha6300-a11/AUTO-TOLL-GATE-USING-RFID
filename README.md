ðŸš¦ Auto Toll Gate System using RFID, Servo Motor, and IR Sensor

This project demonstrates an automatic toll gate system built with Arduino, RFID, Servo motor, LEDs, and an IR sensor.
It allows vehicles with authorized RFID cards to pass, while unauthorized cards are denied.

ðŸ“¸ Project Overview :

RFID Module (RC522) reads the card/tag UID.

Arduino Uno processes the UID.

Servo Motor acts as the toll gate barrier.

Green LED indicates Access Granted.

Red LED indicates Access Denied.

IR Sensor detects when the vehicle passes, and then the gate closes automatically.

ðŸ’» Code

The full Arduino code is available in Auto_Toll_Gate.ino
.
It includes:

RFID card UID verification

Gate opening/closing with servo

LED indicators

IR sensor vehicle detection

ðŸ”‘ Features

âœ… Reads RFID card UID
âœ… Grants/Deny access based on UID
âœ… Controls servo motor as toll gate
âœ… Green LED for Access Granted
âœ… Red LED for Access Denied
âœ… IR sensor closes gate after vehicle passes

ðŸ“Š Workflow

Vehicle approaches toll gate.

RFID card is scanned.

If UID matches â†’ Gate opens, Green LED ON.

IR sensor waits until vehicle passes â†’ Gate closes.

If UID does not match â†’ Red LED ON, access denied.
